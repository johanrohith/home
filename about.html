      Hello! i'm Johan Rohith, a creative, ambitious and naturally introverted guy. I grew up in India. As a Introverted guy, i spent more time in the internet than with people who i meet in real life. I created a YouTube channel in early 2018 with my Brother and began posting videos YouTube under the handle "Tamil Gaming Bro's" in late 2018, at the age of 11. My early content ranged from FreeFire Gameplays to GTA San Andreas Gameplays. The GTA Gameplay video got about 2.5k views in late 2019. After posting various FreeFire videos which didn't earn that much of views, I stopped posting videos ever since in that channel. Again in late 2020 and early 2021, I created another channel named "JoJoTheGqmer" in which I uploaded Minecraft Bedrock Gameplay videos in a Multiplayer Server called "Hyperlands". I worked as a Discord Moderator in Hyperlands's Discord server for a decent amount of time and i spent time with most of my online friends who i met in Hyperlands. I stopped posting videos in that channel in mid 2022. Then As of 2023, I built this website with the knowledge i gained during the period 2020 to 2022. I know about HTML, CSS and a little about Node.js. Other than this, I am just an Internet User who plays games and spent time learning some computer programming languages. I want to know more about Website development in near future and Software Development in the future. Now in mid and late 2023, I am just living an average life as a student. I do have interest in running a business and to invest in stock market when i start to earn money by myself. That's all about me for now
